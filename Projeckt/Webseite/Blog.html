<h2 style="font-style: italic">The Beginning of Tropical Trees 10.12.2020</h2>
<br/>

<pre>
On the 02.12.2020 Tropical Trees IT Support was born, and the Website is in full development now and we are working like mad in the background to create a Website.
We also hired a new Member of Staff. He is a good friend of mine called Simon Wertmueller. Simon will be helping me out in the business,
with the support side of things. Simon Wertmueller is a student in Economics and Rights at a Gymnasium in Bern. He also has a passion in technology and really likes to help when needed ðŸ˜Š.

This is our Blogpost for this month, and we look to post every month with all sorts of topics including how to keep your old devices working for longer! Stay posted on Tropical Trees Blog.
